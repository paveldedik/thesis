\chapter{Evaluation and Analysis}

In the first part of this chapter we briefly characterize the nature of the data set used for evaluation of our models and discuss some specifics of the implementation. In the second part we evaluate and compare the analyzed models using several data sets. In the last part we summarize the results of further analysis.

\section{Data Set}

The data set contains more than 10~million answers from tens of thousands of unique users, mostly Czech citizens~\cite{Papousek2015}. In our experiments, we filtered the data so that it contains only answers of students who practiced at least 50 items, furthermore the places that were answered by less then 100 students were removed. We often run our experiments only on a portion of the whole data set, in such case the answers of students who registered before the oldest question in that part of the data set was answered were removed since it could temper with the results (considering we are interested primarily in models based on timing information and the students have different prior knowledge).

Considering the system is adaptive, the selection of questions is based on student's knowledge, rather than statically programmed by an expert. The system has target probability 75\%, i.e. the questions which are expected to be too hard or too easy for the student are penalized by a \textit{scoring function}. The scoring function is responsible for the selection of question to be practiced~\cite{Stanislav2015thesis}. Note that the adaptability of the system should be taken into consideration as it might have affected the results of our analysis.

The used data set further contains genuinely very different students with distinct prior knowledge, some students are still in school and practice geography in classes, other students already finished school and want to revive their forgotten knowledge (this is further analyzed in chapter~\ref{further-analysis}). There are also tremendous differences between continents, regions and other types of places, all of which vary in the easiness of learning, some are harder to retain and are forgotten faster.

\section{Toolchain}

The models were implemented in Python programming language. Experiments were performed in the Jupyter Notebook interactive environment\footnote{Jupyter Notebook is an open sourced web application for interactive computing, see~\url{https://jupyter.org/}}. Here is a list of the used libraries and modules:

\begin{itemize}
  \item SciPy, NumPy, Pandas
  \item Matplotlib, Seaborn
  \item Scikit-Learn
  \item NetworkX
\end{itemize}

\section{Baseline}

As a baseline we use the standard PFA and two of its extensions. We use acronyms for all evaluated models, here is a list of the baseline models as their acronyms occur in the experiments:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{PFA} -- the original performance factor analysis which we described in chapter~\ref{pfa}. Note that our implementation doesn't consider multiple knowledge components.
  \item \textbf{PFA/E} -- a version of the original PFA model with some aspects of Elo model which we depicted in chapter~\ref{pfae}.
  \item \textbf{PFA/G} -- another version of the original PFA model with a decay factor, the characteristics of the model were outlined in chapter~\ref{pfag}.
\end{itemize}

Note that for the estimation of prior knowledge we use the Elo model briefly described in chapter~\ref{elo}. In any case, we always explicitly mention when the dedicated prior knowledge estimator is used.

\section{Response Time}

The response time of student to a question indicates how much well the item is learned. If the student answered quickly, almost automatically, it is very likely they either know the place very well or don't know at all, depending on the correctness of their answer. On the other hand when the response is longer, the student is probably familiar with the item and might even recall the correct answer.

The Figure~\ref{fig-response-time} demonstrates the relationship between students' response time and the probability of recall. If the student answers suspiciously fast (response time is lower than 800 milliseconds), it usually means they are guessing. It is evident that the highest probability of recall ranges between 1500 and 2000 milliseconds of response time.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/response-time}
  \caption{Relation between students' response times and probability of recall. Each box represents probabilities from all countries that belong in the relevant interval of response times.}
  \label{fig-response-time}
\end{figure}

We evaluate one model focused on improving performance by taking into account the response times of students:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{PFA/E/RT} -- an extended version of the PFA/E model which alters student's knowledge by respecting past response times. We described the model in chapter~\ref{pfart}.
\end{itemize}

Note that some places cover wider area on the map then others, i.e. a question asking a student to locate Russia has generally lower response time than a question requiring to locate Andorra since the student has to zoom using the mouse wheel before they can respond.

\subsection{Parameters}
\label{response-parameters}

The extended PFA model has 2 parameters when we use Elo model for the estimation of prior knowledge. Thus we need to estimate $\gamma$, $\delta$ and the response time function $r(t_d)$. We learned the shape of the function from the data using linear regression and gradient descent.

\section{Memory Decay}

In this chapter we describe parameter optimization and calibration techniques of the models focused on memory decay and forgetting. We focus on the following extensions of models:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{PFA/E/T} -- an extended version of the PFA/E model which adapts the idea of a time effect function. We presented the model in chapter~\ref{pfaet}. In our analysis we examine several time effect functions formalized in chapter~\ref{time-effect-functions} including the staircase function.
  \item \textbf{PFA/G/T} -- our version of the PFA/G model which uses a time effect function instead of a decay factor. The differences were stated in chapter~\ref{pfagt}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Parameters}
\label{memory-parameters}

Standard PFA model has 3 parameters, the initial difficulty of an item $\beta$, weight of each success $\gamma$ and failure $\delta$. In cases where we use Elo model for prior knowledge estimation, we can replace the parameter $\beta$ with $\theta_s - b_c$ which leaves us with only 2 parameters we need to estimate.

Next, a time effect function from the list presented in chapter~\ref{time-effect-functions} has to be chosen. As all the simple functions (logarithmic, exponential and polynomial) have only the two parameters $a$ and $c$, we fitted the models using hill climbing algorithm detailed in chapter~\ref{hill-climbing}. We learned the optimal parameters of the staircase function formalized in chapter \ref{staircase-function} from the data set using the adjusted gradient descent for online learning described in chapter~\ref{gradient-descent}.

In our experiments related to the staircase function, we divided the vector $\iota$ in 10 intervals, we chose the following values: $(0s, 60s]$,$(60s, 90s]$, $(90s, 2.5m]$, $(2.5m, 5m]$, $(5m, 10m]$, $(10m, 30m]$, $(30m, 3h]$, $(3h, 24h]$, $(24h, 5d]$, $(5d, \infty)$. The obtained staircase function is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:learned-time-effect-function}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/learned-time-effect-function}
  \caption{Time effect function as learned from the data with standard deviations. Each point represents average of 10 independent data sets containing answers of students who used the system continuously at least for one week and answered more than 100 answers.}
  \label{fig:learned-time-effect-function}
\end{figure}

It is evident from the figure that the parameters are rather stable (with $\gamma = 1.814 \pm 0.276$ and $\delta = 0.827 \pm 0.095$) and the staircase function seems to be a good choice as a time effect function. The learned values also suggest that none of the simple time effect functions' shapes fits the staircase function, although the polynomial and logarithmic functions are closest approximations.

\subsection{Calibration}
\label{memory-calibration}

Calibration can be used to detect the deviation of model's predictions from the averaged observed frequency of correctness of answers. This is very useful in our case where we need to find out how a model performs with each time effect function over timing distance between concrete practices of individual students. Note that the choice of a metric function (e.g. RMSE) isn't a good choice in this case because it considers all deviations simply as errors in predictions, i.e. it doesn't show whether the model overestimates or underestimates the observed regularity of correct answers. The metric we used in order to calibrate the models is shown in figure~\ref{eq-callibration}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq-callibration}
  \mathit{Correctness} - \mathit{Prediction} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n} (y_i - p_i)
\end{equation}

Using a data set of students who practiced geography actively at least for 5 days and answered more than 50 questions, we compared the calibrations for the models that don't account for timing distances between practices. In Figure~\ref{fig:calibration-time-effect-off}, we can conclude that these models aren't very well calibrated and the analysis also suggests that the decay factor introduced in PFA/G doesn't solve this issue. We also analyzed several previously mentioned time effect functions which we used in the PFA/E/T and PFA/G/T models. The Figure~\ref{fig:calibration-time-effect-on} indicates that this method leads to much better calibrated models.

The graphs in Figure~\ref{fig:calibration2} show the comparison of simple time effect functions. The parameters of each model are depicted in Table~\ref{table:calibration2-parameters}.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:calibration2} suggests that the exponential isn't a good choice as a time effect function for either of the models while the most calibrated models can be achieved by using the polynomial.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{evaluation}

We evaluated the models on several different sets of data, including all answers, African and European countries, USA states, Czech rivers, world mountains and lakes. Parameters of all models were estimated using either hill climbing or the adjusted gradient descent. In all models we used Elo model for the estimation of prior knowledge where we fitted the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ using grid search algorithm.

We compare the performance of all evaluated variations of examined models on a data set containing 150 thousand answers and use the RMSE metric, LL metric and AUC metric for quantification of models' predictions. We also compare the number of correct predictions (the sum of all true positives and negatives).

In Table~\ref{table:results-all-answers} we summarize the values of estimated parameters and used metrics when data set containing all students' answers of all types of places is used, it is clear that the models based on PFA/E perform best although the improvement isn't huge. The performance of all compared time effect functions is very similar, however, the staircase offers the best performance with RMSE $3.402$.

\subsection{Countries and USA States}

Most answers in our data set are from the citizens of the Czech Republic, i.e. Europeans, who generally have much better knowledge of the countries in Europe than for example the countries in Africa. Very important aspect of learning the locations of individual places is their context. It is way easier to encode and retain the locations that are neighbors with an already known place.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/africa-europe-usa-states}
  \caption{Learned values of the staircase function for African countries, European countries and USA states.}
  \label{fig:africa-europe-usa-states}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:africa-europe-usa-states} we observe the differences between learned values of the staircase function when the data set is separated in three by the type of place---African countries, European countries and USA states. The learned values suggest that the rate of forgetting (or more precisely the change in memory activation) is very similar in all examined types of places when the timing distance between current and the last practice is lower than one day, however the African countries and USA states are forgotten faster after longer periods of time.

TODO: table comparing all models.

\subsection{Mountains, Rivers and Lakes}

Another interesting question how the number of facts affects easiness of learning, since intuitively it's easier to learn all facts from domains of small sizes. We divided the data set into three, containing only the answers to questions about either 21 lakes, 71 mountains or 84 rivers. The result of learned parameters of $\gamma$, $\delta$ and the staircase function is shown on Figure~\ref{fig:lakes-rivers-mountains}.

\section{Further Analysis}
\label{further-analysis}

\subsection{At School vs At Home}

An interesting question is how much students' motivation affects the speed of learning or the rate of forgetting. Figure~\ref{fig:at-home-vs-at-school} shows the learned parameters of a staircase function on two different data sets. The first data set labeled as ``At School'' contained only the answers from groups of 10 or more students with the same IP address (the assumption is that these students practice geography in classrooms). The second data set labeled as ``At Home'' contained all the other answers of students.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/at-home-vs-at-school}
  \caption{Comparison of students who practice geography at school (i.e. in classrooms) and students who practice at home (i.e. on their own initiative).}
  \label{fig:at-home-vs-at-school}
\end{figure}

The learned values of the staircase function and the parameters $\gamma$, $\delta$ indicate that students who practice geography at school learn indeed slower and forget the learned material faster then the students who are motivated by some other means. Note that the difference in the rate of forgetting between both types of students may be caused by teaching methods (more material is learned in shorter periods of time). Since the system we analyze is adaptive and selects questions based on student's knowledge, we believe this is not the only cause.

\subsection{Confusion Network}

It is natural to mix up the places that are geographically very close, have similar names or seem somehow similar for entirely different reasons. For example, students typically know the approximate geographical location of the Nordic countries, however they might struggle when determining its exact location, often they confuse Norway with Sweden as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:confusion-network}. If a students chooses Finland when the highlighted place is actually Norway, it usually doesn't mean that they have no knowledge of the country's location. In such cases it seems reasonable to perhaps slightly increase student's knowledge of the place.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/confusion-network}
  \caption{Confusion network of European countries. The edges between countries represent confusion of students. Dark blue edge means that the two connected countries are confused by students quite often while light blue indicates that the countries are still sometimes confused but at least less often.}
