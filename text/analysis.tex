\chapter{Evaluation and Analysis}

In the first part of this section we briefly depict the nature of the data set used for evaluation of our models and discuss some specifics of the implementation. In the second part we evaluate the models using various data sets. In the last part we present the results of further analysis we performed on the data set using the methods discussed in chapter~\textit{evaluation}.

\section{Slepemapy.cz}

For the analysis we used data from the online system for practicing geography \url{http://www.slepemapy.cz}~\cite{Papousek2014}. This system provides adaptive educational environment for learning of geography facts. Since it is adaptive, the selection of questions is based on student's knowledge, rather than statically programmed by an expert. The system has target probability 75\%, i.e. the questions which are expected to be too hard or too easy for the student are penalized by a \textit{scoring function}. The scoring function is responsible for the selection of question to be practiced~\cite{Stanislav2015thesis}. The adaptability of the system should be taken into consideration as it may affect the results of our analysis.

\section{Data Set}

The data set contains more than 10~million answers from thousands of unique users~\cite{Papousek2015}. The data were filtered to contain only students with at least 50 answers and usually divided into 5 data sets, each containing at least 30 thousand answers. The answers of students who registered before the oldest question in the data set was answered were removed since it could temper with the results (considering we are interested primarily in models based on timing information).

The used data set contains genuinely very different students with distinct prior knowledge, some students are still in school and practice geography in classes, other students already finished school and want to revive their forgotten knowledge (this is further analyzed in chapter~\ref{further-analysis}). There are also tremendous differences between continents, regions and other types of places, all of which vary in the easiness of learning, some are harder to retain and are forgotten faster.

\section{Toolchain}

The models were implemented in Python programming language. Experiments were performed in the Jupyter Notebook interactive environment\footnote{Jupyter Notebook is an open sourced web application for interactive computing, see~\url{https://jupyter.org/}}. Here is a list of the used libraries and modules:

\begin{itemize}
  \item SciPy, NumPy, Pandas
  \item Matplotlib, Seaborn
  \item Scikit-Learn
  \item NetworkX
\end{itemize}

\section{Baseline}

As a baseline we use the standard PFA and two its extensions. We use abbreviations for all evaluated models, here is a list of the baseline models as their abbreviations occur in our experiments:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{PFA} -- the original performance factor analysis which we described in chapter~\ref{pfa}. Our implementation, however doesn't consider multiple knowledge components as there is only one.
  \item \textbf{PFA/E} -- a version of the original PFA model with some aspects of Elo model we depicted in chapter~\ref{pfae}.
  \item \textbf{PFA/G} -- another version of the original PFA model with a decay factor, the characteristics of the model were outlined in chapter~\ref{pfag}. The implementation doesn't consider multiple knowledge components.
\end{itemize}

Note that for the estimation of prior knowledge we use the Elo model briefly described in chapter~\ref{elo}. In any case, we always explicitly mention when the dedicated prior knowledge estimator is used.

\section{Response Time}

The response time of student to a question indicates how much well the item is learned. If the student answered quickly, almost automatically, it is very likely they either know the place very well or don't at all, depending on the correctness of their answer. On the other hand when the response is longer, the student is probably familiar with the item and might even recall the correct answer.

The Figure~\ref{fig-response-time} demonstrates the relationship between students' response time and the probability of recall. If the student's answer was suspiciously fast (response time is lower than 800 milliseconds), it usually means they are guessing. If the response time is between 1500 and 2000 milliseconds, it may indicate the student knows the correct answer.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/response-time}
  \caption{Relation between students' response time and probability of recall. Each box represents probabilities from all countries that belong in the relevant interval of response times.}
  \label{fig-response-time}
\end{figure}

We evaluate one model focused on improving performance by taking response times of students into account:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{PFA/E/RT} -- an extended version of the PFA/E model which alters student's knowledge by respecting past response times. We described the model in chapter~\ref{pfart}.
\end{itemize}

Note that some places cover wider area on the map then others, i.e. a question asking a student to locate Russia has generally lower response time than a question requiring to locate Andorra since the student has to zoom using the mouse wheel before they can respond.

\subsection{Parameters}
\label{response-parameters}

The extended PFA model has 2 parameters when Elo model is used for estimation of prior knowledge. Thus we need to estimate $\gamma$, $\delta$ and the response time function $r(t)$. We learned the shape of the function from the data using linear regression.

\section{Memory Decay}

In this chapter we describe parameter optimization and calibration techniques of the models focused on memory decay and forgetting. We focus on the following models' extensions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{PFA/E/T} -- an extended version of the PFA/E model which adapts the idea of a time effect function. We presented the model in chapter~\ref{pfaet}. In our analysis we examined several time effect functions.
  \item \textbf{PFA/G/T} -- our version of the PFA/G model which uses a time effect function instead of a decay factor. The differences were stated in chapter~\ref{pfagt}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Parameters}
\label{memory-parameters}

Standard PFA model has 3 parameters, the initial difficulty of an item $\beta$, weight of each success $\gamma$ and failure $\delta$. In cases where we use Elo model for prior knowledge estimation, we can replace the parameter $\beta$ with $\theta_s - b_c$ which leaves us with only 2 parameters we need to estimate. Nonetheless, a time effect function from the list presented in chapter~\ref{time-effect-functions} has to be chosen as well for the PFA/E/T and PFA/G/T models.

As all the simple functions (logarithmic, exponential and polynomial) have only the two parameters $a$ and $c$, we fitted the models using the greedy search algorithm detailed in chapter~\ref{greedy-search}. However, because our goal is to model the forgetting of students who use the system for practicing geography slepemapy.cz, we also evaluated the staircase function formalized in chapter \ref{staircase-function}. In the case of a staircase function we learn the time effect function from the data set, this could lead to the most accurate and best calibrated model. For the purpose of parameter optimization, we used the adjusted gradient descent described in chapter~\ref{gradient-descent}.

In our experiments with the staircase function, we divided the vector $\iota$ in 10 intervals, we chose the following values: $(0s, 60s]$,$(60s, 90s]$, $(90s, 2.5m]$, $(2.5m, 5m]$, $(5m, 10m]$, $(10m, 30m]$, $(30m, 3h]$, $(3h, 24h]$, $(24h, 5d]$, $(5d, \infty)$. The obtained staircase function is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:learned-time-effect-function}. It is evident from the figure that the parameters are rather stable (with $\gamma = 1.814 \pm 0.276$ and $\delta = 0.827 \pm 0.095$) and the staircase function is thus a good choice for a time effect function.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/learned-time-effect-function}
  \caption{Time effect function as learned from the data with standard deviations. Each point represents average of 10 independent data sets containing answers of students who used the system continuously at least for one week and answered more than 100 answers.}
  \label{fig:learned-time-effect-function}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Calibration}
\label{memory-calibration}

Calibration can be used to detect the deviation of model's predictions from the averaged observed frequency of correctness of answers. This is very useful in our case where we need to find out how a model performs with each time effect function over timing distance between concrete practices of individual students. The choice of RMSE isn't very helpful here because it considers all deviations simply as errors in predictions, i.e. it doesn't show whether the model overestimates or underestimates the observed regularity of correct answers. The metric we used in order to calibrate the models is shown in figure~\ref{eq-callibration}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq-callibration}
  \mathit{Correctness} - \mathit{Prediction} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n} (y_i - p_i)
\end{equation}

Using a data set of students who practiced geography actively at least for 5 days and answered more than 50 questions, we compared the calibrations for the models that don't account for timing distances between answers. In Figure~\ref{fig:calibration-time-effect-off}, we can see that these models aren't very well calibrated and the analysis suggests that the decay factor introduced in PFA/G doesn't solve this issue. We also analyzed several previously mentioned time effect functions which we used in the PFA/E/T and PFA/G/T models. The Figure~\ref{fig:calibration-time-effect-on} indicates that this method leads to much better calibrated models.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{evaluation}

We evaluated the models on several different sets of data, including all answers, African and European countries, USA states, Czech rivers, world mountains and also we compared in-school and out-of-school students. Parameters of all models were estimated using either greedy search or gradient descent. For the estimation of prior knowledge we used Elo model where we fitted the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ using grid search algorithm. In Table~\ref{table:results-all-answers} we compare the performance of all evaluated variations of examined models on a data set containing 150 thousand answers.

\subsection{Countries and USA States}

Most answers in our data set are from the citizens of the Czech Republic, i.e. Europeans, who generally have much better knowledge of the countries in Europe than for example the countries in Africa. Very important aspect of learning the places' locations is their context. It is way easier to encode and retain the locations that are neighbors with an already known place.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/africa-europe-usa-states}
  \caption{Learned values of the staircase function for African countries, European countries and USA states.}
  \label{fig:africa-europe-usa-states}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:africa-europe-usa-states} we observe the differences between learned values of the staircase function when the data set is separated in three by the type of place---African countries, European countries and USA states. The learned values suggest that the rate of forgetting (or more precisely the change in memory activation) is very similar in all examined types of places when the timing distance between current and the last practice is lower than one day, however the African countries and USA states are forgotten faster after longer periods of time.

\subsection{Mountains, Rivers and Lakes}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/lakes-rivers-mountains}

  \label{fig:lakes-rivers-mountains}
\end{figure}

\section{Further Analysis}
\label{further-analysis}

\subsection{At School vs At Home}

An interesting question is how much students' motivation affects the speed of learning or the rate of forgetting. Figure~\ref{fig:at-home-vs-at-school} shows the learned parameters of a staircase function on two different data sets. The first data set labeled as ``At School'' contained only the answers from groups of 10 or more students with the same IP address (the assumption is that these students practice geography in classrooms). The second data set labeled as ``At Home'' contained all the other answers of students.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/at-home-vs-at-school}
  \caption{Comparison of students who practice geography at school (i.e. in classrooms) and students who practice at home (i.e. on their own initiative).}
  \label{fig:at-home-vs-at-school}
\end{figure}

The learned values of the staircase function and the parameters $\gamma$, $\delta$ indicate that students who practice geography at school learn indeed slower and forget the learned material faster then the students who are motivated by some other means. Note that the difference in the rate of forgetting between both types of students may be caused by teaching methods (more material is learned in shorter periods of time). Since the system we analyze is adaptive and selects questions based on student's knowledge, we believe this is not the only cause.

\subsection{Confusion Network}

It is natural to mix up the places that are geographically very close, have similar names or seem somehow similar for entirely different reasons. For example, students typically know the approximate geographical location of the Nordic countries, however they might struggle when determining its exact location, often they confuse Norway with Sweden as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:confusion-network}. If a students chooses Finland when the highlighted place is actually Norway, it usually doesn't mean that they have no knowledge of the country's location. In such cases it seems reasonable to perhaps slightly increase student's knowledge of the place.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/confusion-network}
  \caption{Confusion network of European countries. The edges between countries represent confusion of students. Dark blue edge means that the two connected countries are confused by students quite often while light blue indicates that the countries are still sometimes confused but at least less often.}
