abstract = {Student modeling is a fundamental concept applicable to a variety$\backslash$nof intelligent tutoring systems (ITS). However, there is not a lot$\backslash$nof practical guidance on how to construct and train such models.$\backslash$nThis paper compares two approaches for student modeling, Knowledge$\backslash$nTracing (KT) and Performance Factors Analysis (PFA), by evaluating$\backslash$ntheir predictive accuracy on individual student practice opportunities.$\backslash$nWe explore the space of design decisions for each approach and find$\backslash$na set of ``best practices'' for each. In a head to head comparison,$\backslash$nwe find that PFA has considerably higher predictive accuracy than$\backslash$nKT. In addition to being more accurate, we found that PFA's parameter$\backslash$nestimates were more plausible. Our best-performing model was a variant$\backslash$nof PFA that ignored the tutor's transfer model; that is, it assumed$\backslash$nall skills influenced performance on all problems. One possible implication$\backslash$nis that this result is a general one suggesting there is benefit$\backslash$nfrom considering models that incorporate information from more than$\backslash$nthe typical handful of skills associated with a problem in the transfer$\backslash$nmodel. Alternately, an explanation for this result is the transfer$\backslash$nmodel that our tutor uses is particularly weak. We also found that$\backslash$nboth KT and PFA have relatively low predictive accuracy for cases$\backslash$nwhere students generate incorrect responses, and 2/3 of the model's$\backslash$nerrors are false positives, indicating a better means of determining$\backslash$nwhen students will make mistakes is needed.

abstract = {An experiment was performed to investigate the effects of practice and spacing on retention of Japanese-English vocabulary paired associates. The relative benefit of spacing increased with increased practice and with longer retention intervals. Data were fitted with an activation-based memory model, which proposes that each time an item is practiced it receives an increment of strength but that these increments decay as a power function of time. The rate of decay for each presentation depended on the activation at the time of the presentation. This mechanism limits long-term benefits from further practice at higher levels of activation and produces the spacing effect and its observed interactions with practice and retention interval. The model was compared with another model of the spacing effect (Raaijmakers, 2003) and was fit to some results from the literature on spacing and memory.},

abstract = {Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT)[1] is a user modeling method extensively used in the area of Intelligent Tutoring Systems. In the standard BKT implementation, there are only skill-specific parameters. However, a large body of research strongly suggests that student-specific variability in the data, when accounted for, could enhance model accuracy [5,6,8]. In this work, we revisit the problem of introducing student-specific parameters into BKT on a larger scale. We show that student-specific parameters lead to a tangible improvement when predicting the data of unseen students, and that parameterizing students' speed of learning is more beneficial than parameterizing a priori knowledge. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},
