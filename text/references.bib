abstract = {Student modeling is a fundamental concept applicable to a variety$\backslash$nof intelligent tutoring systems (ITS). However, there is not a lot$\backslash$nof practical guidance on how to construct and train such models.$\backslash$nThis paper compares two approaches for student modeling, Knowledge$\backslash$nTracing (KT) and Performance Factors Analysis (PFA), by evaluating$\backslash$ntheir predictive accuracy on individual student practice opportunities.$\backslash$nWe explore the space of design decisions for each approach and find$\backslash$na set of ``best practices'' for each. In a head to head comparison,$\backslash$nwe find that PFA has considerably higher predictive accuracy than$\backslash$nKT. In addition to being more accurate, we found that PFA's parameter$\backslash$nestimates were more plausible. Our best-performing model was a variant$\backslash$nof PFA that ignored the tutor's transfer model; that is, it assumed$\backslash$nall skills influenced performance on all problems. One possible implication$\backslash$nis that this result is a general one suggesting there is benefit$\backslash$nfrom considering models that incorporate information from more than$\backslash$nthe typical handful of skills associated with a problem in the transfer$\backslash$nmodel. Alternately, an explanation for this result is the transfer$\backslash$nmodel that our tutor uses is particularly weak. We also found that$\backslash$nboth KT and PFA have relatively low predictive accuracy for cases$\backslash$nwhere students generate incorrect responses, and 2/3 of the model's$\backslash$nerrors are false positives, indicating a better means of determining$\backslash$nwhen students will make mistakes is needed.

abstract = {An experiment was performed to investigate the effects of practice and spacing on retention of Japanese-English vocabulary paired associates. The relative benefit of spacing increased with increased practice and with longer retention intervals. Data were fitted with an activation-based memory model, which proposes that each time an item is practiced it receives an increment of strength but that these increments decay as a power function of time. The rate of decay for each presentation depended on the activation at the time of the presentation. This mechanism limits long-term benefits from further practice at higher levels of activation and produces the spacing effect and its observed interactions with practice and retention interval. The model was compared with another model of the spacing effect (Raaijmakers, 2003) and was fit to some results from the literature on spacing and memory.},

abstract = {Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT)[1] is a user modeling method extensively used in the area of Intelligent Tutoring Systems. In the standard BKT implementation, there are only skill-specific parameters. However, a large body of research strongly suggests that student-specific variability in the data, when accounted for, could enhance model accuracy [5,6,8]. In this work, we revisit the problem of introducing student-specific parameters into BKT on a larger scale. We show that student-specific parameters lead to a tangible improvement when predicting the data of unseen students, and that parameterizing students' speed of learning is more beneficial than parameterizing a priori knowledge. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Fits of retention data were examined from 5 conditions: 3 types of cued recall, an old–new recognition task, and a remember–know recognition task. In each condition, 100 participants had either 18 recall or 27 recognition trials at each of 10 delays between 0 and 99 intervening items, providing the first data obtained in experimental psychology that were precise enough to distinguish clearly among simple functions. None of the 105 2-parameter functions tested produced adequate fits to the data. The function y = a₁e–t/1.15 + a₂e–t/T2 + a₃ fit each of the 5 retention conditions. The T₂ parameter in this equation equaled 28 for the 3 recall conditions and the remember–know recognition condition and 13 for the old–new recognition condition. Individuals' recall data fit the same function with parameters varying with gender and scholastic aptitude scores. Reaction times support the claim that the a₁e–t/1.15 term describes working memory, and the remaining 2 terms describe long-term memory. },

While this model has had a variety of successes in modeling memory phenomena, in its current conception it has no mechanism that would produce the spacing effect. A paired-associate memory experiment was conducted and the data from this experiment were fit with an ACT-R memory model using a new decay mechanism. Rather than a set decay rate, this mechanism bases decay for a trial on the current activation at the time of that trial. The spacing effect is a result of this mechanism.},
