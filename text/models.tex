\chapter{Models Based on Timing Information}

The presented models in chapter~\ref{relevant-models} seem to work very well in the context of adaptive practice systems. But could the performance be further improved by taking into account the timing information of students' answers (i.e. the response times or the breaks between practices)? As was discussed in chapter~\ref{spacing-effect}, the spacing effect is observable in environments where the students have no prior knowledge. We are, however, interested in domains where the prior knowledge varies widely between students.
