elo-learning-curve.png
----------------------
Learning curve of ELO model.

* X-axis -- number of training examples (up to 30 000, 20 000 examples were used as a cross-validation set).
* Y-axis -- RMSE

response-time.png
-----------------
Correlation between response time and the probability on recall. Each value in the boxes represents the probability that the user recalles a particular country.

pfa-gradient-descent.png
------------------------
Parameter fitting with gradient descent. The algorithm was run with the following settings:

* step size = 5
* precision = 0.001
* initial gamma = 5
* initial delta = 0.5
* number of training examples = 50 000
